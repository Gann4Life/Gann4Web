            <p>I'm Santiago Ariel Mansilla, AKA Gann4Life, i love making art, music and specially programming.</p>
            <p>I am currently setting up properly this website, putting as much effort as i can with the small knowledge i currently have.<p>
            <p>I do different types of art, which includes digital art, animation, motion graph and video editing.</p>

                <h2>How i learnt to code</h2>
                <p>I started learning about programming since i'm 13 years old. I was born in 2002, September 20.<br>
                I wanted to start really big at first, but with the following days i noticed i wasn't able to do whatever i wanted.<br>
                My project list was kind of huge, idea over idea, experiment over experiment, and using standard assets or 3rd party created content.<br>
                With a few friends we decided to create a very ambicious game, for this project i decided to learn deeply how to program for myself, my own code, my own functions, with a ton of errors, but at the same time i was learning. The project got deleted because of the lack of ideas and custom art.<br>
                After this project, i was able to create my own code and functions, but i was lacking of proper organized code and art, in case i wanted to create a complete game.<br>
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2>How i learnt to create art</h2>
                <p>I've been always interested in complete interaction stuff, but art has grown on me because of the need of an artist for my games.<br>
                Drawing in the kindergarden was always confusing to me, but i enjoyed a lot drawing when i was a kid, i stopped eventually at the age of 8 or more, i don't remember any specific reason.<br>
                Since i was 7 or 8 years old, i used to animate with my friends a lot, we learnt about new software for video editing, we invented techniques like drawing in paint, taking a screenshot and redrawing, a lot of times to create our messy animations with paint and movie maker.<br>
                Over time we learnt about pivot and some other basic software like adobe flash, Cinema 4D, as well as those epic flash and pivot stickman animations.<br>
                With all of that i just made my stuff on my own and without being public. I used to create 3D rigs, 3D animations and 2D animations.<br>
                When i was around 16/17 years old, i got my very first graphic tablet. And since then, i decided to learn to create digital artwork in depth.<br>
                The only key for me to do all of this is patience, chill, enjoy and relax. Otherwise, whatever i do, will be a complete mess.<br>
